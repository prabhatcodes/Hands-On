    "# Artificial Neural Networks with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "An ANN is a Machine Learning model inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brains.\n",
    "But in reality, ANNs have gradually become quite different from their biological cousins.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs are the very core of Deep Learning. They are versatile, powerful and scalable, making them ideal to tackle large and highly complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Biological to Artificial Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "1943: ANNs were introduced by a landmark paper, a Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity. It presented a simplified computational model of how biological neurons might work together in animal brains to perform complex computations using propositional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs will have a profound impact on our lives because:\n",
    "- Huge quantity of data available(ANNs outperform ML techniques on very large and complex problems)\n",
    "- Tremenduos increase in computing power makes it possible to train large neural networks in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "- Even small tewaks in training algorithms have improved them and had a huge positive impact.\n",
    "- Theoretical limitations of ANNs have turned out to be benign in practice.(People thought that ANNs will be stuck in local optima, but as it turns out, this is rather rare in practice and they are usually fairly close to the global optimum)\n",
    "- Products using ANNs garner more attention and have entered into a virtuous circle of funding and progress.\n",

    "### The Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN architectures, which is based on a slightly different artificial neuron called a threshold logic unit(TLU), or sometimes a linear threshold unit (LTU).\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs and outputs are numbers instead of binary on-off values, and each input connection is associated with a weight. The TLU computes a weighed sum of its inputs, then applies a step function to that sum and outputs that result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides a Perceptrom class which implements a single-TLU network:"
